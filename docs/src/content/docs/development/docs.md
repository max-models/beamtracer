title: Building the docs
description: How this documentation site is built from Markdown pages, Jupyter notebooks and docstrings.
---

The site in `docs/` is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and
[Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/). It has three kinds of pages:

- **Hand-written pages** in `docs/src/content/docs/`, as Markdown or MDX.
- **Examples**, converted from the Jupyter notebooks in `tutorials/` by `starlight-notebooks`
  (the `section` setting in `docs/package.json` publishes them under `examples/`). Each
  notebook is executed and its outputs (text, images, tables) are written into an MDX page.
- **Example scripts**, a "Scripts" group of the Examples, built from the Python scripts in
  `examples/` by `docs/tools/examples.py`. Each page shows the module docstring, the complete
  source file, and its Matplotlib plots.

Guides, when a project has them, are hand-written pages that explain the model or a concept;
anything runnable belongs in the Examples.
- **API reference**, generated from the docstrings by
  [starlight-pydocs](https://ewels.github.io/starlight-pydocs/), one page per module.

The configuration (`defineDocs` in `docs/astro.config.mjs`), the look, the header, the notebook
tool and the build workflow come from the shared
[starlight-theme](https://github.com/max-models/starlight-theme) of the max-models projects;
change them there, and update the version in `docs/package.json` and
`.github/workflows/docs.yml` to pick up a new release.

## Requirements

- Node 22 or newer.
- The package installed with the `docs` extra: `pip install -e ".[docs]"`.

## Commands

```bash
make docs-install     # npm packages and the Python docs extra
make docs-notebooks   # execute tutorials/*.ipynb and convert them to pages
make docs-examples    # run examples/*.py and publish their plots
make docs-dev         # live preview at http://localhost:4321/beamtracer/
make docs-build       # the static site in docs/dist, as in CI
make docs-preview     # serve docs/dist
make docs-clean       # remove generated pages and build output
```

`make docs-notebooks` only reruns a notebook whose cells changed since the last run; pass
`FORCE=1` to rerun all of them.

## Writing example notebooks

Put a Jupyter notebook in `tutorials/`. Examples are authored only as `.ipynb` files. Its first `# Heading` becomes the page title and the first
paragraph its description. Cell tags control the output:

| Tag                | Effect                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `remove-cell`      | the cell is left out of the page         |
| `hide-input`       | the code is hidden, the outputs are kept |
| `fold-input`       | the code is in a closed "Show code" box  |
| `remove-output`    | the outputs are left out                 |
| `raises-exception` | an error output is shown, not a failure  |

Math in `$...$` and `$$...$$` is rendered with KaTeX.

## Writing example scripts

Put a Python script in `examples/` with a module docstring. Its first line becomes the page
title and the rest becomes the description. Leave Matplotlib figures open at the end of the
script so the docs builder can save them as plots. The complete script is shown on the page.
